        <p>
        Software Engineer as an iOS Developer since 2020. Always working towards clean code, intuitive user experience, data security. I am striving to keep up with new technologies. I am interested in science and technology which encourages me to participate in inventing new things and concepts. But, my greatest love is programming, software architecture, algorithms, discovering best practices… in short, converting ideas into reality.

        As a huge fan of Apple’s mobile platform and most of its products, I chose iOS development as my primary focus. I believe that every programmer needs to be a power user of the device/platform for which he is developing. Because iPhone is a device with which I spend most of my time, becoming an iOS developer was a logical step in my life.
