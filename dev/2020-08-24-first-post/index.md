Cher lecteur,
bonjour et bienvenue sur mon blog.

This blog is mainly focused on explaining developing things with several languages like Japanese, French, and English. To be specific, this blog is more like a notebook with a bunch of mistakes and inaccurate information. This is a notebook for reminding me of what I studied and motivating me. So if you are looking for reliable information, you are in the wrong place.

I focus on developing iOS applications theses days. As days went by, I realize the importance of a foundation. That's why I will upload some basic concepts of iOS referring to [Mobile Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/godrm/mobile-developer-roadmap) for brushing up knowledge. You can check what we should study for becoming an iOS developer by clicking the references below.
